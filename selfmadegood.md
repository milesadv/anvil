BRAND: Self Made Good (@madeselfgood - Instagram)
TAGLINE: Ora et Labora (Pray and Work)
LAUNCH: March 2026, London

BRAND PHILOSOPHY:
Self Made Good is a luxury menswear brand for men aged 18-40 who have earned their success through discipline, work, and craft. The brand represents the intersection of working-class grit and old-money sophistication—self-made wealth expressed through high design, quality, and legacy-building.

Core belief: Luxury through labour. Legacy through devotion to craft.

The name "Self Made Good" is a British phrase meaning "succeeded despite humble origins" + "self-made" (earned not inherited). "Ora et Labora" is the Benedictine monastic motto—pray and work—representing devotion + discipline = lasting achievement.

TARGET AUDIENCE:
Men 18-40 in London, Manchester, Hong Kong. They:
- Train seriously (gym, calisthenics, sport)
- Appreciate high fashion and design (Represent, ALD, old-money aesthetic)
- Listen to underground music, attend culture events
- Are building businesses, careers, legacies
- Value quality, craftsmanship, things that last
- Self-made or aspiring; not trust-fund wealth

LITERARY/CULTURAL REFERENCES:
The Iliad (glory, fate, earned honour), Murakami's Men Without Women (masculine interiority, loneliness, city nights), Mishima's The Sailor Who Fell from Grace with the Sea (purpose, the sea, lost grand causes), John Williams' Stoner (quiet endurance, ordinary tragedy elevated).

AESTHETIC & TONE:
- Visual: Cinematic, high-contrast, minimal, editorial. Think A24 films meet luxury fashion campaigns.
- Color palette: Deep blacks, charcoals, one accent (forest green or burgundy). Old-money restraint.
- Typography: Refined serif (Freight, Canela, Tiempos) + clean grotesk (Suisse, ABC Monument, Neue Haas).
- Photography/video: Golden hour, empty cities at dawn, close-ups of hands/fabric/details, brutalist architecture, training alone, slow camera movements, negative space.
- Tone: Stoic, literary, quietly intense. Never motivational-poster energy. More philosophical than hype. British understatement meets classical virtue.

CONTENT PILLARS:
1. Ora (Prayer/Devotion) — 30%: Early mornings, preparation, solitude, quiet strength before the work begins
2. Labora (Work/Labour) — 40%: Training, building, hands working, the grind nobody sees, craft
3. Earned Luxury — 30%: Golden hour moments, sharp clothing, cities, rewards of discipline, quality objects

WEBSITE ADAPTATION GOALS:
Transform your article visualizer into a brand manifesto experience:
- Use the article/editorial format to tell the Self Made Good story episodically
- Each "article" is a piece of brand philosophy: What is Ora et Labora? Why legacy matters? The cost of excellence?
- Visualizer becomes a way to navigate brand pillars, product drops (when they come), and the philosophy
- Heavy on cinematic imagery (integrating Runway/Weavy AI-generated clips and stills)
- Minimal text, maximum visual storytelling
- Email capture integrated subtly (CTA: "First Drop — March 2026")

FIRST DEPLOYMENT OBJECTIVES:
- Establish brand world and philosophy before showing any products
- Build email list (target: 200-500 quality signups by end of February)
- Create intrigue through editorial depth (not just "coming soon" landing page)
- Showcase design-forward, cinematic aesthetic that signals high-end positioning
- Give early followers something to explore and return to

TECHNICAL NOTES:
- Next.js/React stack
- AI content generation: Runway (cinematic video clips), Weavy.AI (social media content)
- Mobile-first (critical for Instagram/TikTok traffic)
- Fast load times, smooth animations
- Clean URLs for sharing specific "articles"/manifesto pieces

BRAND VOICE EXAMPLES:
- "Luxury through labour."
- "Work without witness. Build without permission."
- "What will remain when everything else burns away?"
- "Devotion to craft. Discipline as prayer."
- "Earned, not given."
- "The work doesn't care about your excuses."
- Never: motivational clichés, hustle culture language, loud branding
